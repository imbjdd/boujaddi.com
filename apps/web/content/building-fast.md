Speed is one of the most underrated skills in product development. In a world where ideas are cheap and execution is everything, the ability to build quickly is a massive competitive advantage.

## Why Speed Matters

Time is your most valuable resource as a builder. The faster you can:
- Test your assumptions
- Get feedback from users
- Iterate on your product

The more likely you are to find product-market fit before you run out of runway.

## The Compound Effect

Building fast doesn't mean building poorly. It means:
- Understanding the 80/20 rule deeply
- Having strong technical fundamentals
- Making confident decisions

When you can ship in days what takes others weeks, you get 10x more iterations in the same time period. This compounds rapidly.

## Tools and Mindset

The right tools matter, but mindset matters more. Some principles I follow:
- Start with the simplest possible solution
- Don't optimize prematurely
- Ship first, polish later
- Use boring, proven technology

**The goal isn't to write perfect code. It's to learn what to build.**
