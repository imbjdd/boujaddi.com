Hackathons have been an incredible learning experience for me. They've shaped how I approach building products and taught me invaluable lessons about speed, collaboration, and execution.

## The Learning Curve

Every hackathon is a compressed learning cycle. You have **24-48 hours** to:
- Come up with an idea
- Build a working prototype
- Present it convincingly

This intense timeframe forces you to:
1. Make quick decisions
2. Cut scope ruthlessly
3. Focus on what matters

## Speed as a Skill

Speed isn't just about typing fast. It's about:
- Knowing your tools deeply
- Having good intuition about what will work
- Being comfortable with "good enough"

The best hackers aren't necessarily the best engineers, but they're the ones who can ship fastest while maintaining quality.

## Building a Network

Hackathons are where I met some of my closest friends and collaborators. There's something special about building together under pressure that creates strong bonds.
